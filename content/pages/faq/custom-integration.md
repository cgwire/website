## Built for Pipeline Teams

Kitsu is not a closed production tracker.

It is built with technical teams in mind — Pipeline TDs, CTOs, and technical directors who need structure, flexibility, and clean access to production data.

Whether you are running a lightweight pipeline or a fully automated production environment, Kitsu is designed to integrate — not replace everything you have built.

---

## A Clean, Well-Documented REST API

Kitsu provides a fully documented REST API that exposes all core production data:

- Projects
- Episodes and sequences
- Shots and assets
- Tasks and statuses
- Assignments
- Comments and previews
- Time logs

Everything available in the UI is accessible via API.

This allows you to automate reporting, trigger render jobs, sync with internal databases, or build custom dashboards.

---

## Python Client for Fast Integration

For technical teams working in Python-based environments, Kitsu provides a dedicated Python client.

This makes it easy to:

- Query production data
- Update task statuses automatically
- Create shots and assets programmatically
- Connect render farms or review systems
- Synchronize with internal tools

Instead of building raw HTTP calls, your TDs can work with a clean, production-ready interface.

---

## Designed to Connect With Your DCC Tools

Kitsu can be integrated with the tools your artists already use.

Typical integrations include:

- Sending publishes from DCC software
- Linking render outputs to tasks automatically
- Updating statuses based on pipeline events
- Syncing versions with internal asset management systems

Kitsu becomes the central production database — while your creative tools remain unchanged.

---

## Webhooks & Automation

Need real-time triggers?

Kitsu supports webhooks to notify your systems when something changes:

- A task moves to “Approved”
- A new version is uploaded
- A comment is added
- A shot is created

This enables automated workflows and event-driven pipelines without manual intervention.

---

## Flexible Workflow Configuration

Every studio works differently.

Kitsu allows you to define:

- Custom task types
- Custom statuses
- Department structures
- Validation workflows

You can adapt Kitsu to your production methodology without writing heavy custom code.

For highly specialized pipelines, your technical team can extend behavior through API integrations rather than modifying the core system.

---

## Open-Source Transparency

Kitsu is open-source.

That means:

- You can audit the code.
- You can understand exactly how the database works.
- You are never dependent on hidden proprietary logic.
- You can host on-premise if required.

For technical decision-makers, this transparency removes uncertainty and long-term risk.

---

## Works for Small and Structured Teams Alike

If you have no Pipeline TD, Kitsu works out of the box.

If you have a dedicated pipeline team, Kitsu gives them the tools to build advanced automation on top of it.

You don’t need to rebuild your pipeline to adopt Kitsu.

You simply connect it.
