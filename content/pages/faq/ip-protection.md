## Data Ownership

You own 100% of your data. Always. Your projects, assets, comments, previews, and production metadata remain your exclusive property when using Kitsu Cloud.

We never claim ownership over your content, never reuse it, and never analyze it for commercial purposes. Your IP stays yours — contractually and technically.

At any time, you can export your data. No lock-in. No barriers. Full portability.

## Infrastructure & Hosting (France-Based Servers)

Kitsu Cloud is operated by CGWire and hosted in France on secure infrastructure provided by OVHcloud.

Hosting in France means your data benefits from strong European privacy protections and GDPR compliance standards.

Our infrastructure follows modern cloud best practices for reliability, redundancy, and isolation. Data is encrypted in transit via HTTPS and encrypted at rest on secure servers.

By hosting within France and the European Union, we ensure high standards of data sovereignty, privacy, and regulatory protection.

## Access Control & Permissions

Kitsu provides granular role-based permissions, allowing you to control exactly who can view, edit, review, or export production data.

You can define permissions per project, per department, or per user role — ensuring that sensitive client projects remain compartmentalized.

Strong password policies and secure authentication flows are enforced to prevent unauthorized access.

## Cloud or On-Premise — Your Choice

Kitsu is open-source. That means full transparency. You can audit the codebase and understand exactly how your data is handled.

If your studio requires complete internal hosting, Kitsu can be deployed on-premise with minimal overhead.

Kitsu Cloud is ideal for distributed teams who want zero infrastructure maintenance. On-premise is ideal for studios with strict internal policies. The choice is yours.

## Backups & Disaster Recovery

Automated backups are performed regularly to protect your production data.

Redundant systems reduce the risk of downtime and data loss.

Our disaster recovery processes are designed to restore services quickly in the unlikely event of infrastructure failure.

## IP Protection & Confidential Productions

We understand the realities of animation and VFX production: NDAs, broadcaster requirements, and high-value intellectual property.

CGWire applies strict internal security practices, including secure SSH key management, encrypted communication channels, restricted production access, and infrastructure monitoring.

Your client’s trust is critical. Our security approach is built to help you maintain it.

## Compliance & Best Practices

Our France-based hosting ensures compliance with European data protection regulations (GDPR), among the strictest privacy frameworks in the world.

We follow industry-standard security best practices in infrastructure management, encryption, and operational security.

Security is not a marketing checkbox for us — it is part of how we design, host, and operate Kitsu Cloud every day.

## Why Studios Trust Kitsu Cloud

Kitsu is developed and maintained by CGWire, a company specialized in production tracking solutions for animation and VFX studios.

Because Kitsu is open-source, there is no black box. No hidden processes. No proprietary lock-in.

You get the flexibility of open software with the reliability of a managed cloud service hosted in France under strong privacy protections.
