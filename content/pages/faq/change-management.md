## The Real Risk Isn’t the Software. It’s Adoption.

Most production tracking failures don’t happen because of missing features.

They happen because:

- Artists don’t use the tool.
- Supervisors revert to spreadsheets.
- Producers maintain parallel systems.
- Training was rushed or unclear.

Kitsu is designed to reduce resistance — not create it.

---

## Designed for Artists, Not Just Producers

Kitsu focuses on clarity and usability.

- Clean, readable interfaces  
- Simple task views  
- Clear status workflows  
- Minimal configuration overhead  

Artists should understand what to do in seconds — not after a 2-hour onboarding session.

When a tool feels intuitive, adoption happens naturally.

## Structured Onboarding for Every Role

We don’t treat “the studio” as one block.

Different roles need different training:

- Producers: project structure, reporting, planning  
- Supervisors: review flows, validation, approvals  
- Artists: task updates, uploads, feedback loops  
- Technical teams: API and automation  

We provide live onboarding sessions and role-based guidance to ensure everyone knows exactly what matters to them.

---

## Progressive Rollout

Adoption improves when change is staged.

Instead of switching everything overnight, many studios:

- Start with one project  
- Pilot with one department  
- Train team leads first  
- Expand gradually  

This approach builds internal champions who help the rest of the team transition smoothly.

---

## Documentation That People Actually Use

Training doesn’t end after onboarding.

Kitsu provides:

- Clear written documentation  
- Searchable knowledge base  
- Tutorial videos  
- Practical examples  

New hires can onboard themselves without requiring senior staff to repeat explanations.

---

## Support During the Transition

Change creates questions.

During rollout, we remain available to:

- Answer workflow questions  
- Adjust configurations  
- Clarify best practices  
- Help production leads refine processes  

The goal is not just to install software — it’s to stabilize usage.

---

## Reducing Fear of Change

When teams resist new tools, it’s usually because they fear:

- Losing time  
- Breaking their workflow  
- Being monitored  
- Increased complexity  

Kitsu is structured around clarity and collaboration — not control.

It centralizes communication, reduces email noise, and eliminates spreadsheet duplication.

Most teams feel relief once the transition is complete.

---

## Adoption Is a Design Principle

Kitsu was built specifically for animation and VFX studios.

That means:

- Familiar production structures  
- Clear shot and asset hierarchies  
- Real-world workflow logic  
- Focused feature set (not overwhelming toolboxes)  

The result: faster learning curves and higher adoption rates.

## A Tool Everyone Actually Uses

The return on investment of a production tracker only happens when everyone uses it.

Our goal is simple:

From artist to producer to supervisor — everyone should feel comfortable on day one.

Change doesn’t have to be painful.

With the right structure, it becomes an upgrade.
