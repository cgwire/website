## Switching Without Disruption

Changing your production tracking system can feel dangerous. Deadlines are tight. Teams are busy. The last thing you need is operational chaos.

Kitsu migrations are designed to avoid disruption. We help you transition progressively, project by project if needed, so your team keeps delivering while the system changes underneath — safely and smoothly.

No big-bang switch. No frozen production weeks.

## Structured Migration Plan

We don’t just give you documentation and wish you luck.

Every migration follows a structured plan:

1. Audit your current setup (projects, workflows, user roles).
2. Map your pipeline to Kitsu’s structure.
3. Import data and validate integrity.
4. Train production leads and supervisors.
5. Roll out to artists.
6. Monitor and adjust.

This process typically takes days or a few weeks depending on studio size — not months.

## Importing Your Existing Data

Your historical data matters. We help you preserve it.

Kitsu supports structured imports (CSV and API-based imports), making it possible to migrate:

- Projects and episodes
- Shots and assets
- Task structures
- Statuses and assignments
- Comments and notes

If you are migrating from another production tracking solution, we help you extract and transform your data so nothing critical is lost.

## Parallel Run (If You Want It)

For studios that prefer zero risk, we can support a parallel phase.

Run your old system alongside Kitsu for a short transition period. Validate reports. Compare outputs. Ensure producers are comfortable.

Once your team is confident, you switch fully — with no surprises.

## Training That Accelerates Adoption

Most resistance to switching tools comes from fear of complexity.

Kitsu is designed to be intuitive for artists and production teams. Still, we provide:

- Live onboarding sessions
- Role-based training (producers, supervisors, artists)
- Documentation and video tutorials
- Direct support during rollout

The goal is simple: everyone should feel comfortable from day one.

## Pipeline & API Support

If your studio has a Pipeline TD or technical team, Kitsu’s REST API and Python client make integration straightforward.

We assist in connecting Kitsu to:

- DCC tools
- Render farm systems
- Internal asset management
- Custom review pipelines

You don’t need to rebuild your pipeline. Kitsu adapts to it.

## No Vendor Lock-In

Because Kitsu is open-source, you are never trapped.

You can export your data at any time. You can move to on-premise hosting if your policies change. You can audit the codebase.

Switching to Kitsu should reduce risk — not create new dependency.

## Designed for Real Studios

We understand animation and VFX production constraints: delivery pressure, distributed teams, tight budgets.

That’s why our migration approach prioritizes:

- Stability
- Predictability
- Clear timelines
- Human support

Switching production management tools doesn’t have to be painful.

With Kitsu, it’s structured, supported, and safe.
