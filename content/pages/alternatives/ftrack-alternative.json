        "Ftrack is an expansive toolbox. To get started with Ftrack, you must hire several people dedicated to customizing UIs, and integrating it into your pipeline. You will end up with something tailor-made, but it will require a lot of effort. These developments may also need significant maintenance in the future. Lastly, you will need internal training sessions for your customized version of Ftrack.",
        "In contrast, Kitsu works great right out of the box. All UIs are designed with ease of use in mind, making it easy to get started. Our dedicated support team is available to assist with setup if needed. However, to fully integrate Kitsu with your pipeline and take advantage of its database, you may need a pipeline TD. While Kitsu provides flexibility to define different workflows, it may not be suitable for projects with highly specialized pipelines."

As a result, the added time taken to learn and customize the system may counter the benefits gained from it. Moreover, projects that require this level of specificity are rare.",
        "Kitsu focuses on animation and VFX projects. Through close collaboration with hundreds of studios, we have designed a system that is efficient yet flexible enough to adapt to most situations. Our goal is to ensure that everyone in the studio can use Kitsu from day one. While there may be some very specialized use cases that aren't suitable, you can be confident that everyone in the studio will be comfortable with Kitsu."

        "CGWire engineers have a strong track record in cloud hosting and apply all protocols to ensure the security of your data (HTTPS, strict password management policies, strong SSH key management, background checks, etc.). It is only a matter of time before we qualify for the necessary security certifications."
